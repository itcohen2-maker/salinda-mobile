## 0. Research Addendum (2026-04-11, AUTHORITATIVE)

This section was added after a codebase research pass revealed that the original problem statement in §1 was built on a wrong model of the codebase. Where §0 and later sections conflict, **§0 wins**. The later sections remain in the document as historical context and to preserve the decision log (§4, decisions 4–7), which is still valid.

### 0.1 What I found

**The app's real entry point is `card/index.tsx` (9,600+ lines).** `package.json` has `"main": "index.tsx"`. Everything under `src/components/`, `src/context/`, and `src/hooks/` that I inspected in the original spec research is **dead code** — orphaned older copies that `index.tsx` does not import. The only file under `src/components/` that `index.tsx` imports is `SoundDemoScreen.tsx`. Likewise, `card/App.tsx`, `card/GameScreen.tsx` (the top-level 76KB one), `card/Dice3D.tsx`, and `card/AnimatedDice.tsx` are also not imported by `index.tsx` — older backups.

**`index.tsx` defines everything inline:**

| Symbol | Line in `index.tsx` |
|---|---|
| `gameReducer` | 934 |
| `GameContext` | 1507 |
| `GameProvider` | 1508 |
| `useGame` | 1643 |
| `DrawPile` | 2308 |
| `DiscardPile` | 2341 |
| `ActionBar` | 3592 |
| `PlayerHand` | 4079 |
| `StartScreen` | 4643 |
| `TurnTransition` | 6523 |
| `GameScreen` | 7324 |
| `GameOver` | 8612 |
| App render tree (play-mode router) | 9210–9256 |

**The local reducer already speaks the new-engine vocabulary.** `index.tsx`'s `gameReducer` uses the same phase names as the server engine (`turn-transition`, `pre-roll`, `building`, `solved`, `game-over`) and the same action verbs (`START_GAME`, `BEGIN_TURN`, `ROLL_DICE`, `CONFIRM_EQUATION`, `STAGE_CARD`, `CONFIRM_STAGED`, `PLAY_IDENTICAL`, `PLAY_FRACTION`, `DEFEND_FRACTION_SOLVE`, `DEFEND_FRACTION_PENALTY`, `DRAW_CARD`, `END_TURN`). The stage/commit flow already exists in the local game. Fraction defense already exists in the local game. `validTargets` already exists.

**`GameProvider` already unifies local + online state.** Lines 1508–1642 implement a state provider that reads either from the local reducer (offline) or from a multiplayer `override` (online `PlayerView`), with client-only overlays for notifications, sound prefs, and the joker modal. `dispatch` routes actions to the local reducer offline and to `override.dispatch` (socket) online. This was the UI-layer architectural goal of the original B2 scope — it's already done.

**But the local reducer and the server engine are NOT the same engine.** They have parallel, drifted implementations of the same rules:

- `PLAY_FRACTION` attack math differs: server computes `newTarget = topOfDiscard / denom` (attacks the pile-top value); local computes `newTarget = denom` (standalone target).
- `index.tsx`'s state shape has extra fields not in `ServerGameState`: `moveHistory`, `equationOpsUsed`, `challengeSource`, `activeFraction`, `lastDiscardCount`, `selectedCards`, `equationHandSlots`, `equationHandPick`, `notifications`, guidance/sound prefs, plus several more.
- The two files use parallel i18n namespaces: local uses `local.*` keys, server uses `toast.*` / `msg.*`.
- `shared/i18n/he.ts:353` has a comment *"Legacy src/context/GameContext (simplified ruleset)"* confirming that the `src/context/GameContext.tsx` file is intentionally legacy dead code, predating the inline `gameReducer` in `index.tsx`.

**`index.tsx` has zero bot logic.** Confirmed by exhaustive grep — no `isBot`, `botBrain`, `runBot`, `makeBot`, or variants. All bot code lives in `server/src/socketHandlers.ts` and never crosses into the client.

### 0.2 Revised goal

Add a "Play vs Bot" entry point to the single-player flow inside `index.tsx`, with Easy/Hard bot difficulty. Minimal footprint: port the server bot's *decision logic* into a new client-side brain targeting the local reducer's action vocabulary. Do not touch the server. Do not attempt to unify the local and server reducers — that divergence is a pre-existing code smell unrelated to this feature and deserves its own project.

Decision made during research (R1 of R1/R2/R3): proceed with minimal bot add-on. Engine unification is explicitly **deferred** and should be captured as a separate design spec if pursued.

### 0.3 Revised architecture

Cleanup of dead code is **explicitly out of scope** for this feature. It's a separate mechanical task with zero functional impact and should not be bundled with a feature PR.

### 0.4 Revised state additions

Added to the local `GameState` type inside `index.tsx` (existing interface, new fields):

```typescript
// Added fields — at the end of the existing GameState interface:

/**
 * Bot configuration for this game. null = pass-and-play (no bots).
 * When non-null, botConfig.playerIds lists the player IDs that the bot
 * clock should take turns for, and botConfig.difficulty controls the
 * Profile 3 comparator flip in buildBotStagedPlan.
 *
 * Consolidated into one discriminated field so we cannot end up in the
 * invalid state "difficulty set but playerIds empty" or vice versa.
 */
botConfig: { difficulty: BotDifficulty; playerIds: ReadonlyArray<number> } | null;

/**
 * Monotonically increasing counter incremented on every BOT_STEP dispatch,
 * regardless of whether the action succeeded, failed, or was a no-op.
 * Used only by the bot clock's useEffect dependency array to guarantee
 * the clock re-schedules after every tick even when the rest of state
 * is unchanged — prevents "frozen bot" bugs where a no-op BOT_STEP
 * leaves no tracked field changed and the effect never re-runs.
 */
botTickSeq: number;
```

Added to the existing `Player` type inside `index.tsx`:

```typescript
isBot: boolean;   // defaults false; set true for bot players in START_GAME
```

**REQUIRED: `Player` does not have an `isBot` field today — it must be added as `isBot: boolean` (default `false` for PLAY_AGAIN preservation and RESET_GAME).** Per survey doc section 4, the `Player` interface at line 152 is exactly `{ id: number; name: string; hand: Card[]; hasOneCardLeft: false }` — no `isBot` field exists anywhere on the interface. This is a new field addition, not a verification of an existing one. Player construction at line 1005 (survey doc section 7) is currently `{ id: i, name: p.name, hand: hands[i], hasOneCardLeft: false }` — adding `isBot` must be done explicitly.

Added to the `GameAction` union inside `index.tsx`:

```typescript
// BEFORE (current shape at line 357, per survey doc section 3):
| { type: 'START_GAME'; players: { name: string }[]; difficulty: 'easy' | 'full'; fractions: boolean; showPossibleResults: boolean; showSolveExercise: boolean; timerSetting: '30' | '60' | 'off' | 'custom'; timerCustomSeconds?: number; difficultyStage?: DifficultyStageId; enabledOperators?: Operation[]; allowNegativeTargets?: boolean; mathRangeMax?: 12 | 25; abVariant?: AbVariant }

// AFTER (amended to support vs-bot):
| { type: 'START_GAME'; players: Array<{ name: string; isBot: boolean }>; difficulty: 'easy' | 'full'; fractions: boolean; showPossibleResults: boolean; showSolveExercise: boolean; timerSetting: '30' | '60' | 'off' | 'custom'; timerCustomSeconds?: number; difficultyStage?: DifficultyStageId; enabledOperators?: Operation[]; allowNegativeTargets?: boolean; mathRangeMax?: 12 | 25; abVariant?: AbVariant; mode: 'pass-and-play' | 'vs-bot'; botDifficulty?: BotDifficulty }
```

Note: the current `START_GAME` action shape has **no** `mode`, `botDifficulty`, or `botPlayerIds` fields (survey doc Finding 3 and section 3, line 357). These fields must be **added** to the action type union in `index.tsx` — they do not exist today. The `players` array's items must also be amended from `{ name: string }` to `{ name: string; isBot: boolean }`. No `hostGameSettings` nesting — all game settings are individual top-level fields on both the action and `GameState`.

```typescript
| { type: 'BOT_STEP' }                     // NEW — fired by bot clock
```

The existing `gameReducer` in `index.tsx:934` handles `START_GAME` and `PLAY_AGAIN` as a **fused case** (line 940–1017). Both action types share the same body, branching via `action.type === 'PLAY_AGAIN' ? preservedValue : newValue` for every field. `PLAY_AGAIN` preserves difficulty, operators, math range, timer settings, etc. from the previous game.

The fused handler must be amended as follows:

1. The `playersSeed` construction (line 943–946) currently produces `{ name: string }[]`. Amend the `START_GAME` branch to produce `{ name: string; isBot: boolean }[]` by reading `action.players` which now carries `isBot` per player. The `PLAY_AGAIN` branch continues to read from `st.players.map((p) => ({ name: p.name, isBot: p.isBot }))` — preserving the bot flag from the previous game so "play again" against a bot stays a bot game.
2. The `players` array construction at line 1005 currently is `playersSeed.map((p, i) => ({ id: i, name: p.name, hand: hands[i], hasOneCardLeft: false }))`. Amend to include `isBot: p.isBot`.
3. For `START_GAME`: if `action.mode === 'vs-bot'`, set `botConfig = { difficulty: action.botDifficulty ?? 'easy', playerIds: playersSeed.map((p, i) => p.isBot ? i : -1).filter(id => id >= 0) }`. Otherwise set `botConfig = null`.
4. For `PLAY_AGAIN`: preserve the previous game's `botConfig` via `botConfig: st.botConfig` (following the same `PLAY_AGAIN ? preserved : new` pattern as every other field).
5. Initialize `botTickSeq: 0` for both branches.
6. Leave all existing behavior (deck generation, card dealing, discard seeding, guidance turns, AB variant, difficulty stage, tournament table, etc.) untouched.

`RESET_GAME` already exists at line 1494 (per M1 survey). It spreads `initialState` plus explicitly preserved fields (`hasSeenIntroHint`, `hasSeenSolvedHint`, `soundsEnabled`, `guidanceEnabled`). Adding `botConfig: null` and `botTickSeq: 0` to `initialState` means they reset to null/0 on RESET_GAME automatically, which is correct — leaving a game resets the bot.

**Important: `HostGameSettings` is not a nested object in the local reducer.** The server engine defines `HostGameSettings` as an interface and nests it on `ServerGameState.hostGameSettings`. The local reducer in `index.tsx` **flattens** these fields directly onto `GameState` — `enabledOperators`, `allowNegativeTargets`, `mathRangeMax`, `showFractions`, `showPossibleResults`, `showSolveExercise`, `timerSetting`, `timerCustomSeconds`, `abVariant`, `difficultyStage` are all top-level `GameState` fields, read/written individually by the reducer. The bot brain and the StartScreen advanced panel must speak this flat vocabulary, not the nested `HostGameSettings` object shape. Wherever earlier spec sections said "update `hostGameSettings.enabledOperators`," they mean "update the top-level `enabledOperators` field on `GameState`."

This is not a code change for M5 — the reducer already works this way. It's a correction to M2 (bot brain reading these fields) and M6 (StartScreen writing to them via `START_GAME` action fields).

### 0.5 Revised bot clock (reducer + useEffect + useRef)

The bot clock has **three** coordinated pieces: the `BOT_STEP` reducer case, the `useEffect` scheduling hook inside `GameProvider`, and a `useRef` for timer-deadline stability. Missing any piece produces a real bug class identified during architectural review.

#### 0.5.1 Reducer case: drain the entire plan in one tick

**Critical correction from review:** the earlier draft said the bot re-derives the plan every tick during `solved` and picks the next unstaged card. This is wrong — the server bot (`handleBotBuilding` in `socketHandlers.ts:429-459`) drains `confirmEquation → stageCard × N → confirmStaged` as a tight synchronous burst inside one `runBotStep` call. Re-planning between stages would produce mid-equation plan switches with illegal stages. The local bot must do the same: on `BOT_STEP`, if the decided action is `confirmEquation`, the reducer must recursively apply `confirmEquation`, then each `stageCard`, then `confirmStaged`, all in one reducer return. This preserves atomicity and matches server semantics.

```typescript
// Inside index.tsx's gameReducer. gameReducer is a top-level function
// declaration with signature (st, action, tf) — see line ~934.
// The recursive call below passes tf through explicitly.
case 'BOT_STEP': {
  // Always increment the tick nonce, even for no-op paths. This is the
  // single field the bot clock's useEffect depends on to guarantee
  // re-scheduling after a no-op BOT_STEP. Without this, a no-op
  // BOT_STEP leaves no tracked field changed, the effect doesn't re-run,
  // and the clock stops firing — "frozen bot" bug.
  const stWithTick = { ...st, botTickSeq: st.botTickSeq + 1 };

  if (stWithTick.phase === 'game-over') return stWithTick;
  const current = stWithTick.players[stWithTick.currentPlayerIndex];
  if (!current || !stWithTick.botConfig) return stWithTick;
  if (!stWithTick.botConfig.playerIds.includes(current.id)) return stWithTick;

  const action = decideBotAction(stWithTick, stWithTick.botConfig.difficulty);
  if (!action) {
    // Planner produced nothing — fall back to drawCard to guarantee
    // forward progress on the turn. Guard against infinite recursion by
    // not falling back if the planner itself returned drawCard.
    return applyBotActionAtomically(stWithTick, { kind: 'drawCard' }, tf);
  }
  return applyBotActionAtomically(stWithTick, action, tf);
}
```

Where `applyBotActionAtomically` is a helper defined **inside** `gameReducer` (not exported) that handles the multi-step drain:

```typescript
function applyBotActionAtomically(
  st: GameState,
  action: BotAction,
  tf: TFunction,
): GameState {
  // For single-step actions, translate and recurse once.
  if (action.kind !== 'confirmEquation') {
    const translated = translateBotAction(st, action);
    if (!translated) {
      // Translator failed (e.g., cardId not in hand). Last-resort fallback:
      // draw a card. If draw also fails to translate, return st unchanged.
      if (action.kind === 'drawCard') return st;
      const drawTranslated = translateBotAction(st, { kind: 'drawCard' });
      if (!drawTranslated) return st;
      return gameReducer(st, drawTranslated, tf);
    }
    return gameReducer(st, translated, tf);
  }

  // confirmEquation — drain the entire plan in one atomic burst:
  // confirmEquation → stageCard × N → confirmStaged.
  const confirmTranslated = translateBotAction(st, action);
  if (!confirmTranslated) {
    const drawTranslated = translateBotAction(st, { kind: 'drawCard' });
    if (!drawTranslated) return st;
    return gameReducer(st, drawTranslated, tf);
  }
  let next = gameReducer(st, confirmTranslated, tf);

  // After confirmEquation, stage every card in action.stagedCardIds.
  // The plan is captured at decision time (in the action itself); we do
  // NOT re-run the planner here, which would risk target drift.
  const alreadyStaged: string[] = [];  // track cards staged so far for rollback
  for (const cardId of action.stagedCardIds) {
    const stageTranslated = translateBotAction(next, {
      kind: 'stageCard',
      cardId,
    });
    if (!stageTranslated) {
      // A planned card is no longer stageable — the local reducer rejected it.
      // IMPORTANT: Roll back by unstaging all cards already staged in previous
      // loop iterations before falling back to drawCard. This fixes a latent bug
      // in the server bot (server bot reference doc Finding #1): the server's
      // handleBotBuilding calls drawCard without unstaging already-staged cards
      // if stageCard fails mid-loop, potentially leaving orphan staged cards in
      // room state. The local bot explicitly fixes this by unstaging first.
      let rollback = next;
      for (const stagedId of alreadyStaged) {
        const unstageTranslated = translateBotAction(rollback, { kind: 'unstageCard', cardId: stagedId });
        if (unstageTranslated) rollback = gameReducer(rollback, unstageTranslated, tf);
      }
      const drawTranslated = translateBotAction(st, { kind: 'drawCard' });
      if (!drawTranslated) return st;
      return gameReducer(rollback, drawTranslated, tf);
    }
    alreadyStaged.push(cardId);
    next = gameReducer(next, stageTranslated, tf);
  }

  // Finally, confirmStaged.
  const confirmStagedTranslated = translateBotAction(next, {
    kind: 'confirmStaged',
  });
  if (!confirmStagedTranslated) return next;
  return gameReducer(next, confirmStagedTranslated, tf);
}
```

**Note on `BotAction.confirmEquation`:** this action must carry `stagedCardIds: ReadonlyArray<string>` as a field so the plan is captured at decision time and does not need to be re-derived. Update §5.5 `BotAction` type accordingly in M2:

```typescript
| { kind: 'confirmEquation';
    target: number;
    equationDisplay: string;
    equationCommits: EquationCommitPayload[];
    stagedCardIds: ReadonlyArray<string>;  // cards to stage after confirmEquation
  }
```

The single `stageCard` / `unstageCard` `BotAction` kinds are retained only for defensive recovery paths — they are never produced by the planner's happy path.

**Recursion depth:** finite. For a 10-card hand, the worst case is `confirmEquation` + 10 `stageCard` + `confirmStaged` = 12 recursive `gameReducer` calls. Bounded, no stack risk. Do not allow nested `BOT_STEP` within `BOT_STEP` — if any future translated action is `{ type: 'BOT_STEP' }`, reject it in the translator.

#### 0.5.2 useEffect scheduling hook

The effect lives inside `GameProvider` (line ~1508 of `index.tsx`). Two critical constraints from frontend review:

1. **Depend on `localState`, not the merged `state`.** The merged `state` is rebuilt via object spread every render when `override` is non-null (lines 1597–1613), so any field read from `state` will appear to change identity every render and thrash the timer.
2. **Gate the entire effect on `!override`.** The bot clock must never fire during online mode. Relying on `botConfig.playerIds.includes(current.id)` as the only gate is a latent bug — online mode could have stale offline `botConfig` in `localState`.

Implementation:

```typescript
const botTimerDeadlineRef = useRef<{
  dueAt: number;
  turnSignature: string;
} | null>(null);

useEffect(() => {
  // Hard gate: online mode never runs the local bot clock.
  if (override) {
    botTimerDeadlineRef.current = null;
    return;
  }

  if (localState.phase === 'game-over') return;
  if (!localState.botConfig) return;
  const current = localState.players[localState.currentPlayerIndex];
  if (!current || !localState.botConfig.playerIds.includes(current.id)) {
    botTimerDeadlineRef.current = null;
    return;
  }

  // Only schedule in phases the bot can act in.
  // Note: 'roll-dice' is an additional phase in the live code (survey doc section 6,
  // Finding 1: type GamePhase = 'setup' | 'turn-transition' | 'pre-roll' | 'building' |
  // 'solved' | 'roll-dice' | 'game-over' — 7 phases, not 6). The render tree (survey doc
  // section 12) does NOT handle 'roll-dice' explicitly for local play — it falls to the
  // default branch (renders StartScreen). Investigation: 'roll-dice' appears only in
  // gamePhasesForToasts (index.tsx line 8684) and is likely a dormant/online-only phase
  // not reachable in local single-player flow. The bot clock treats 'roll-dice' the same
  // as 'pre-roll' (i.e., acts in it) as a belt-and-suspenders measure in case the phase
  // becomes reachable in a future build.
  if (
    localState.phase !== 'turn-transition' &&
    localState.phase !== 'pre-roll' &&
    localState.phase !== 'roll-dice' &&   // treat same as 'pre-roll'; see Finding note above
    localState.phase !== 'building' &&
    localState.phase !== 'solved'
  ) {
    return;
  }

  // Signature of the current turn context. When this changes, we want a
  // NEW timer. When it stays the same across unrelated re-renders, we
  // want to KEEP the existing timer rather than rescheduling — otherwise
  // unrelated re-renders (notifications, sound toggle, etc.) would cancel
  // the pending timer before it fires.
  const turnSignature = [
    localState.phase,
    localState.currentPlayerIndex,
    localState.hasPlayedCards ? '1' : '0',
    localState.stagedCards.length,
    localState.equationResult ?? 'null',
    localState.pendingFractionTarget ?? 'null',
    localState.botTickSeq,
  ].join('|');

  const now = Date.now();
  const existing = botTimerDeadlineRef.current;
  if (existing && existing.turnSignature === turnSignature && existing.dueAt > now) {
    // Same turn context, existing timer still pending — do nothing.
    return;
  }

  // New turn context (or stale deadline): schedule a fresh timer.
  const delay = 900 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 700);
  const dueAt = now + delay;
  botTimerDeadlineRef.current = { dueAt, turnSignature };

  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    // Sanity guard: if the phase changed between scheduling and firing,
    // don't dispatch. The next render's effect will schedule again if
    // needed.
    botTimerDeadlineRef.current = null;
    localDispatch({ type: 'BOT_STEP' });
  }, delay);

  return () => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
  };
}, [
  override,
  localState.phase,
  localState.currentPlayerIndex,
  localState.hasPlayedCards,
  localState.stagedCards.length,
  localState.equationResult,
  localState.pendingFractionTarget,
  localState.botConfig,
  localState.botTickSeq,
  localState.players,
]);
```

The `turnSignature` ref is the key innovation: unrelated re-renders (notifications, sound toggle, guidance) recompute the same signature and skip rescheduling. Only an actual turn-state change produces a new signature and a new timer. This prevents the "timer never fires because every unrelated render clears it" bug identified in frontend C4.

**Strict Mode compatibility:** React 19 Strict Mode double-invokes effects in dev. First run schedules a timer and stores deadline in ref; cleanup clears timer but leaves ref (ref persists across cleanup). Second run sees the same signature and the ref's stale deadline (but `existing.dueAt > now` is still true because nanoseconds have passed), so it reuses — wait, this is wrong: the first run's timer was cleared, so we do need to re-schedule on the second run. Fix: clear the ref in cleanup.

```typescript
  return () => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    botTimerDeadlineRef.current = null;  // allow fresh schedule on next effect run
  };
```

#### 0.5.3 Context value must be memoized before the bot clock ships

**Frontend C1:** `index.tsx:1641` currently returns `<GameContext.Provider value={{ state, dispatch }}>{children}</GameContext.Provider>` — a fresh object literal every render. This is confirmed by survey doc section 9 Finding 8 and the verbatim quote of line 1641:

```typescript
// Current line 1641 (survey doc section 9):
return <GameContext.Provider value={{ state, dispatch }}>{children}</GameContext.Provider>;
```

The `value` prop is `{ state, dispatch }` — a new object literal created on every render, NOT wrapped in `useMemo`. Without memoization, every `useGame()` consumer re-renders on every `BOT_STEP` dispatch. With 15+ consumers × ~12 bot turns × ~1 dispatch/sec, this is ~180 useless whole-screen reconciles per game on mid-range Android.

**This is a prerequisite fix.** It must land in M5 alongside the bot clock, not as a follow-up, because shipping the bot without it makes the app visibly laggy in dev testing and masks other perf issues.

```typescript
// Replace line 1641:
//   return <GameContext.Provider value={{ state, dispatch }}>{children}</GameContext.Provider>;
// With:
const contextValue = useMemo(() => ({ state, dispatch }), [state, dispatch]);
return <GameContext.Provider value={contextValue}>{children}</GameContext.Provider>;
```

Per survey doc section 9: `dispatch` is wrapped in `useCallback` (line 1615) and `state` is either `localState` (stable reference when unchanged) or the merged object. So the `useMemo` dependency array `[state, dispatch]` correctly captures the only two values that should trigger consumer re-renders.

#### 0.5.4 Input lock overlay during bot turns

**Frontend input-race fix:** during the 900–1599 ms bot "think" window (exact delay formula: `900 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 700)` — range is 900 to 1599 ms inclusive, per server bot reference doc section 6 / Finding #5), `currentPlayerIndex` already points at the bot and human taps on `PlayerHand` / `ActionBar` / `DrawPile` / `DiscardPile` may be accepted by existing "is my turn" checks that don't know about bots. The least-invasive mitigation is a single overlay component that renders on top of the game area when the current player is a bot and absorbs all touches.

Add an inline component inside `index.tsx` (matching the codebase convention of inline components):

```typescript
function BotThinkingOverlay() {
  const { state } = useGame();
  const { t } = useLocale();
  if (!state.botConfig) return null;
  const current = state.players[state.currentPlayerIndex];
  if (!current || !state.botConfig.playerIds.includes(current.id)) return null;
  if (state.phase === 'game-over') return null;
  return (
    <View
      pointerEvents="box-only"  // absorbs touches but lets children render
      style={styles.botThinkingOverlay}
    >
      <Text style={styles.botThinkingText}>{t('botOffline.thinking')}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

Render this overlay as the last child of `GameScreen` inside `index.tsx` (line ~7324, after every other game-area child) so it sits on top in the z-order. It intentionally does not block the `StartScreen` or `GameOver` screens.

Add `botOffline.thinking` to i18n (§0.7).

### 0.6 Revised bot action translation

The bot brain is platform-agnostic: it returns a `BotAction` (§5.5 of the original spec, amended in §0.5.1 to add `stagedCardIds` to the `confirmEquation` variant). The `translateBotAction` shim maps each `BotAction` kind to an existing `GameAction`.

**Type import requirement (architect N2):** `src/bot/executor.ts` must `import type { GameAction, GameState, Card } from '../../index'` (or whatever export path works — M1 verifies that `index.tsx` can export these types). Do NOT duplicate `GameAction` inside `src/bot/`. The translator's return type must be `GameAction | null`, so TypeScript catches any drift between the bot's expectations and the live reducer vocabulary at compile time.

**Recursion guard:** the translator must reject any translated action with `type === 'BOT_STEP'`. This is a belt-and-suspenders defense against someone adding a future `BotAction` kind that accidentally maps back to itself. Concretely:

```typescript
export function translateBotAction(
  state: GameState,
  action: BotAction,
): GameAction | null {
  const translated = translateInner(state, action);
  if (translated && translated.type === 'BOT_STEP') {
    // Prevent infinite recursion in gameReducer.
    return null;
  }
  return translated;
}
```

Translation table:

> **Translator note:** The bot brain (`botBrain.ts`) works with string `cardId` values (matching server bot semantics). The **translator** (`executor.ts`) is responsible for resolving `cardId → Card` by looking up `state.players[currentPlayerIndex].hand.find(c => c.id === cardId)`. If `findCard` returns `undefined` (card no longer in hand), `translateBotAction` must return `null` to trigger the drawCard fallback. All card-carrying actions (`STAGE_CARD`, `UNSTAGE_CARD`, `PLAY_IDENTICAL`, `PLAY_FRACTION`, `DEFEND_FRACTION_SOLVE`) take a full `Card` object, NOT a `cardId` string — per survey doc section 3.

| BotAction | Translated to local GameAction |
|---|---|
| `{ kind: 'beginTurn' }` | `{ type: 'BEGIN_TURN' }` |
| `{ kind: 'rollDice' }` | `{ type: 'ROLL_DICE' }` |
| `{ kind: 'playIdentical', cardId }` | `{ type: 'PLAY_IDENTICAL', card: findCard(cardId) }` — `card` is a full `Card` object (survey doc section 3, line 370) |
| `{ kind: 'playFractionAttack', cardId }` | `{ type: 'PLAY_FRACTION', card: findCard(cardId) }` — `card` is a full `Card` object (survey doc section 3, line 377) |
| `{ kind: 'playFractionBlock', cardId }` | `{ type: 'PLAY_FRACTION', card: findCard(cardId) }` — `card` is a full `Card` object (survey doc section 3, line 377) |
| `{ kind: 'confirmEquation', target, equationDisplay, equationCommits, equationOps }` | `{ type: 'CONFIRM_EQUATION', result: target, equationDisplay: equationDisplay, equationOps: equationOps, equationCommits: equationCommits }` — field is `result` (NOT `equationResult`); `equationOps: Operation[]` is **required** (survey doc section 3, line 201). Per the `CONFIRM_EQUATION` reducer case at `index.tsx:1082–1097`, `equationOps` is stored into `state.equationOpsUsed` (line 1089) and represents the list of operators used in the committed equation. |
| `{ kind: 'stageCard', cardId }` | `{ type: 'STAGE_CARD', card: findCard(cardId) }` — `card` is a full `Card` object (survey doc section 3, line 366) |
| `{ kind: 'unstageCard', cardId }` | `{ type: 'UNSTAGE_CARD', card: findCard(cardId) }` — `card` is a full `Card` object (survey doc section 3, line 367); `UNSTAGE_CARD` EXISTS in the reducer |
| `{ kind: 'confirmStaged' }` | `{ type: 'CONFIRM_STAGED' }` |
| `{ kind: 'drawCard' }` | `{ type: 'DRAW_CARD' }` |
| `{ kind: 'endTurn' }` | `{ type: 'END_TURN' }` |
| `{ kind: 'defendFractionSolve', cardId, wildResolve? }` | `{ type: 'DEFEND_FRACTION_SOLVE', card: findCard(cardId), wildResolve }` — `card` is a full `Card` object (survey doc section 3, line 378) |
| `{ kind: 'defendFractionPenalty' }` | `{ type: 'DEFEND_FRACTION_PENALTY' }` |

> **`PLAY_OPERATION` does NOT exist** in the `GameAction` union (survey doc section 3: "PLAY_OPERATION — does NOT exist in the union"). Operation cards are played via `STAGE_CARD` (staged into the play area along with number cards) or via `SELECT_EQ_OP` / `SELECT_EQ_JOKER` / `PLACE_EQ_OP` for the equation-hand slots. The bot never needs to dispatch `PLAY_OPERATION`. Operation cards committed to the equation go into `equationCommits` on the `CONFIRM_EQUATION` action — this is exactly how the server bot works (server bot reference doc sections 1 and 2: `buildBotCommits` returns `EquationCommitPayload[]` placed in `equationCommits`).

> **`BotAction.confirmEquation` must carry `equationOps: Operation[]`** in addition to the fields already listed in §0.5.1. The bot brain must populate this from `buildBotCommits` / the plan — it corresponds to the operator(s) committed via `equationCommits` resolved to their `Operation` type. Per survey doc section 3, line 201, `equationOps` is a required field on `CONFIRM_EQUATION`.

The exact field names in each translated action match the `GameAction` union in `index.tsx` as documented by the survey doc (section 3).

**`PLAY_FRACTION` note:** because `index.tsx`'s `PLAY_FRACTION` attack rule differs from the server engine's (newTarget = denom vs. newTarget = topOfDiscard / denom), the bot's attack-fraction heuristic must be retargeted to the local rule. Specifically, `handleBotPreRoll`'s "play an attack fraction if `validateFractionPlay(card, topDiscard)` returns true" check uses a shared validator. If that validator also lives in `index.tsx` inline (not imported from `shared/`), the bot must use the local validator, not the one imported from `server/` or `shared/`. This is verified in Task 1.

**`buildBotCommits` joker fallback note (Correction 13):** the client bot brain's `buildBotCommits` port should use the same `enabledOperators?.[0] ?? '+'` fallback pattern as the server bot (server bot reference doc section 1). If the local `GameState.enabledOperators` is an empty array, `[0]` returns `undefined` and the joker resolves as `'+'`. However, `enabledOperators` is guaranteed non-empty in practice: the `START_GAME` reducer branch at `index.tsx:320-322` (survey doc section 7) uses `action.enabledOperators && action.enabledOperators.length > 0 ? action.enabledOperators : stageCfg.enabledOperators` — it always falls back to the stage config's operators, which are non-empty by construction. The `initialState` also sets `enabledOperators: ['+']`. The fallback `?? '+'` is therefore belt-and-suspenders; document that both conditions hold (non-empty by construction AND fallback present as safety net).

**`buildBotStagedPlan` scoring note (Correction 14):** `buildBotStagedPlan` scores plans purely by `stagedCards.length + equationCommits.length` — a greedy card-count maximizer with no strategic value weighting and no lookahead (server bot reference doc section 2: `const score = stagedCards.length + equationCommits.length`). Profile 3 Easy = minimizer comparator and Profile 3 Hard = maximizer comparator refer to **raw card count** — the total number of cards discarded per equation solve. A Profile 3 implementer must NOT assume there is a value-weighted scoring function to flip — "maximum" and "minimum" are purely about card count. Easy discards the fewest cards per equation; Hard discards the most cards per equation. The comparator switch (`score > bestPlan.score` for Hard vs `score < bestPlan.score` for Easy) is the only code change between the two profiles.

### 0.7 Revised i18n (split by scope)

Keys are split across two namespaces by where they're used. This matches the mental model of a dev debugging StartScreen (who will grep `start.*`) vs a dev debugging bot runtime behavior (who will grep `botOffline.*`).

**StartScreen labels → `start.*`** (alongside existing StartScreen keys):

| Key | English | Hebrew |
|---|---|---|
| `start.mode` | Mode | מצב |
| `start.modePassAndPlay` | Pass and play | משחק מקומי |
| `start.modeVsBot` | Play vs Bot | שחק מול בוט |
| `start.botDifficulty` | Bot difficulty | רמת בוט |
| `start.botEasy` | Easy | קל |
| `start.botHard` | Hard | קשה |
| `start.advancedSettings` | Advanced game settings | הגדרות מתקדמות |

**Bot runtime strings → `botOffline.*`** (new namespace, for strings that appear *during* a bot game):

| Key | English | Hebrew |
|---|---|---|
| `botOffline.botName` | Bot | בוט |
| `botOffline.thinking` | Bot is thinking… | הבוט חושב… |

The `botOffline.*` namespace is deliberately separate from `local.*` (existing inline-reducer status messages) and `toast.*` / `msg.*` (server-bot status messages) to avoid collisions and make the feature's runtime strings greppable as a group.

### 0.8 Revised rollout

Nine milestones, each a mergeable commit. M0 was added because the project has no test runner and no existing tests — `card/package.json` has no `jest`/`vitest` dep, and there are no `jest.config.*` / `vitest.config.*` files. Adding a test runner is a prerequisite to M3/M4/M4.5. The decision is Jest + `jest-expo` (see §0.8.1). M4.5 (integration test against the live reducer) was added after architectural review identified that unit-testing the bot brain in isolation is not sufficient to catch local-vs-server rule drift.

| # | Milestone | Files touched | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| M0 | Install and configure Jest + `jest-expo` preset for the `card/` package. Add `jest` devDependency, `jest-expo` devDependency, `@types/jest`, `@testing-library/react-native` (for future tests), and appropriate transform-ignore / module-name-mapper settings for React Native + Expo. Add `jest.config.js` (or `jest` block in `package.json`). Add `"test": "jest"` script to `card/package.json`. Write one trivial smoke test at `src/__tests__/smoke.test.ts` that asserts `1 + 1 === 2` to verify the runner actually runs. Verify `npm test` passes. | `card/package.json`, `card/jest.config.js` (new), `card/src/__tests__/smoke.test.ts` (new) | `npm test` reports 1 passing smoke test; no warnings about unresolved Expo/RN modules |
| M1 | Survey `index.tsx` — document the exact signature of `gameReducer` (including `tf`), every field of `GameState`, every variant of `GameAction` (exact field names), the `Player` / `Card` / `HostGameSettings` / `BotDifficulty` / `EquationCommitPayload` types, the inline `validateFractionPlay` / `validateIdenticalPlay` / `validateStagedCards` helpers, the exact phase transitions, whether `index.tsx` can `export type GameAction` (or requires a tsconfig tweak), and the project's test runner (Vitest / Jest / none). Write findings into `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-11-index-tsx-survey.md`. | None (read-only) | Survey doc exists; the doc answers every question in this cell |
| M2 | Create `src/bot/types.ts` (BotDifficulty, BotAction union — note that `confirmEquation` carries `stagedCardIds: ReadonlyArray<string>` and `equationOps: Operation[]`) and `src/bot/botBrain.ts` — pure `decideBotAction(state, difficulty): BotAction \| null`. Imports `GameState` and local `validateFractionPlay` / `validateIdenticalPlay` / `validateStagedCards` from `index.tsx` so the brain uses the **local** reducer's rules, not the server's. Profile 3 Easy = minimizer comparator in the planner (card-count only — see §0.6 scoring note). Bot brain reads game-settings fields (`enabledOperators`, `mathRangeMax`, etc.) **directly from top-level `GameState`** — NOT from a nested `hostGameSettings` object (which does NOT exist on the local `GameState`). Per survey doc section 2, all these fields are flat top-level fields on `GameState`: `enabledOperators: Operation[]`, `mathRangeMax: 12 \| 25`, `timerSetting`, `allowNegativeTargets`, etc. | `src/bot/types.ts`, `src/bot/botBrain.ts` | File compiles against real `index.tsx` types |
| M3 | Bot brain unit tests: `src/bot/__tests__/botBrain.test.ts`. Cover every phase transition from the decision table, plus the Profile 3 Easy vs Hard comparison. Fixture states must include at least two distinct valid plans so Easy/Hard produce different scores (otherwise the Profile 3 test is vacuous). | `src/bot/__tests__/botBrain.test.ts`, plus whatever test runner config M1 says the project needs | All bot brain unit tests pass |
| M4 | Create `src/bot/executor.ts` — `translateBotAction(state, action): GameAction \| null` + `findCardInHand(state, cardId)`. Imports `GameAction` type from `index.tsx`. Includes the recursion guard rejecting any `BOT_STEP` translation. Unit tests in `src/bot/__tests__/executor.test.ts` covering every BotAction kind, cardId-not-found, and the recursion guard. | `src/bot/executor.ts`, `src/bot/__tests__/executor.test.ts` | Translator unit tests pass |
| M4.5 | Integration test against the live local reducer: `src/bot/__tests__/integration.test.ts`. Add `export { gameReducer, initialState }; export type { GameState, GameAction };` to `index.tsx` so the test can import them. Note: `index.tsx` **already has one existing export** at line 3024 (`export type EquationBuilderRef = { resetAll: () => void } \| null;` — per survey doc section 13), so the file is already a module and adding further export statements is safe with no tsconfig blockers. The new exports should be placed near line 3024 or wherever is stylistically consistent — the implementer decides placement in M4.5. Runs full bot turns from fixture states: pre-roll normal, pre-roll under fraction defense, building with plan, building without plan, solved phase draining. Asserts state advances to the next player without errors and without the bot getting stuck. This is the "drift detector" for local-vs-server rule differences — the single test that catches the `PLAY_FRACTION` attack math divergence and similar. | `src/bot/__tests__/integration.test.ts`, `index.tsx` (new export statement near line 3024) | All integration tests pass; each scenario completes a full bot turn; pass-and-play sanity check still works |
| M5 | Wire the bot into `index.tsx`: (a) `useMemo` the context value at line 1641 — prerequisite fix (current line is NOT memoized per survey doc Finding 8); (b) add `botConfig` and `botTickSeq` to `GameState` and `initialState`; (c) REQUIRED: add `isBot: boolean` to `Player` interface (it does NOT exist today — survey doc section 4 confirms `Player` is `{ id: number; name: string; hand: Card[]; hasOneCardLeft: boolean }` with no `isBot` field); (d) amend `START_GAME` handler — the action shape must ALSO be amended to add `mode`, `botDifficulty`, and `isBot` per-player fields (none exist today per survey doc section 3 Finding 3); (e) amend `RESET_GAME` handler; (f) add `BOT_STEP` case with `applyBotActionAtomically` helper; (g) add bot clock `useEffect` + `useRef` deadline in `GameProvider` reading from `localState`; (h) add inline `BotThinkingOverlay` component; (i) render overlay as last child of `GameScreen`. | `index.tsx` (targeted edits; no refactor of existing code) | App compiles; pass-and-play 2-player still works; bot game Hard plays end-to-end manually; bot game Easy plays end-to-end manually; input lock works (human cannot tap during bot think-time) |
| M6 | `StartScreen` vs-bot entry point: mode toggle using the existing **two-option toggle pattern** (`hsS.toggleGroup` + styled `toggleBtn`/`toggleOn`/`toggleOff`, same template as the `numberRange` row at `index.tsx:5732–5746` — NOT `HorizontalOptionWheel` which is for 3+ options); bot difficulty toggle using the same two-option pattern (visible only when mode === 'vs-bot'), conditionally rendered like the custom-timer row at line 5835 (`{timer === 'custom' && ...}`); advanced settings disclosure reusing the existing `advancedSetupOpen` precedent (line ~4643); vs-bot `START_GAME` dispatch path. `botBrain.ts` reads `enabledOperators`, `mathRangeMax`, and other game-settings fields **directly from top-level `GameState`** (not from a nested `hostGameSettings` object — those fields are all top-level per survey doc section 2). Add new `start.*` labels and `botOffline.*` runtime keys to `shared/i18n/en.ts` and `shared/i18n/he.ts`. Verify RTL behavior on Hebrew locale. `Keyboard.dismiss()` on mode change. | `index.tsx` (StartScreen region, line 4643 onward), `shared/i18n/en.ts`, `shared/i18n/he.ts` | Manual playthrough checklist passes |
| M7 | Verification pass: full manual checklist (§0.9); inspect any bot-game edge cases discovered during M5–M6; confirm no regressions in pass-and-play or online. | None (verification only) | Checklist clean |

#### 0.8.1 Why Jest + jest-expo (not Vitest)

The project is Expo + React Native + TypeScript with React 19. Four test-runner options were evaluated:

- **Vitest:** Fast, modern, pure TS. Breaks on React Native module resolution (`react-native`, `expo`, `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`, `expo-av`, etc.) and M4.5 requires importing from `index.tsx` which transitively pulls in all of those. Workable for pure-function unit tests of the bot brain (M3/M4) but not for integration tests (M4.5).
- **Jest + jest-expo preset:** React Native ecosystem canonical. `jest-expo` handles the entire RN/Expo module resolution out of the box — transforms for `.ts/.tsx/.js`, stubs for native modules, sensible defaults for React 19. Heavier setup than Vitest (~30 min first-time) but unblocks M4.5 completely. **Chosen.**
- **No test runner:** Drops M3/M4/M4.5, relies on manual checklist only. Loses the drift detector that architectural review elevated to critical. Rejected.
- **ts-node scripts:** Works for pure-function tests with no imports from `index.tsx`. Fails for M4.5. Rejected because a partial answer doesn't unblock the critical milestone.

M0's gate is deliberately conservative: "one trivial smoke test passes." That's enough to prove the runner is wired up without investing in a rich fixture before we know the runner config is correct. M3/M4/M4.5 build on top of a known-good M0.

**Zero server changes. Zero online-multiplayer risk.** Milestones M0, M1, M2, M3, M4 are pure additions to `card/` dev tooling and `src/bot/` and cannot break existing runtime behavior. M4.5 adds one line to `index.tsx` — an `export` statement exposing `gameReducer`, `initialState`, `GameState`, and `GameAction` so the integration test can import them. An export-only edit cannot change runtime behavior but does touch `index.tsx`; the M4.5 gate must include "pass-and-play still works" as a sanity check. M5–M6 edit `index.tsx` but only: memoize an existing context value, add new reducer cases, add new state fields, add a new inline overlay component, and append a new `StartScreen` section. No refactor of existing code.

### 0.9 Revised testing

Three test layers:

**1. Bot brain unit tests (M3).** Fixture-driven tests of `decideBotAction`. Cover every row of the decision table (§5.5), plus the Profile 3 Easy/Hard comparison with a fixture state that has at least two distinct plans with different scores.

**2. Translator unit tests (M4).** Fixture-driven tests of `translateBotAction`. Cover every `BotAction` kind, cardId-not-found-in-hand, and the recursion-guard rejecting `BOT_STEP` translations.

**3. Integration tests against the live reducer (M4.5).** The critical drift detector. Imports the actual `gameReducer` from `index.tsx` and runs full bot turns from fixture starting states. Must cover:
- Pre-roll normal (bot rolls, gets a plan, confirms, stages, confirm-staged, end-turn).
- Pre-roll under fraction defense (bot defends with divisible / wild / counter / penalty).
- Building with plan (bot builds and drains in one tick, verify final state is next player's turn).
- Building without plan (bot draws a card, verify end of turn).
- Profile 3 Easy vs Hard on identical starting state: Easy discards fewer cards over a full game than Hard. Exact count threshold is TBD by M4.5 tuning — pick a threshold that's reliable without being trivially met.

Each integration test asserts:
- No reducer errors.
- Bot is not stuck (`botTickSeq` increments, `currentPlayerIndex` advances within ≤ 20 BOT_STEP dispatches).
- Final state is legal (hand counts match expected, discard pile grew by the right amount, phase is sensible for the next turn).

**Engine unit tests are explicitly out of scope** — the engine is the existing `index.tsx` reducer and is validated by existing gameplay working.

**Manual playthrough checklist (before merging to main):**

1. Offline pass-and-play, 2 players: completes end-to-end. (Regresses M5 reducer edits.)
2. Offline pass-and-play, 4 players: completes end-to-end.
3. Offline vs bot, Easy: completes; bot visibly plays timidly (discards 1–2 cards per equation); human wins most games over 3 playthroughs.
4. Offline vs bot, Hard: completes; bot plays aggressively (discards 3–4 cards per equation); human loses some games over 3 playthroughs.
5. **Input lock test:** during the bot's 900–1599ms think-time (range is `900 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 700)` ms — 900 to 1599 inclusive), tap `PlayerHand`, `DrawPile`, and `DiscardPile` repeatedly. No dispatches should fire; the "Bot is thinking…" overlay should absorb all touches. (Regresses §0.5.4.)
6. **Frozen bot test:** start a vs-bot game where the bot's first hand is all fractions and jokers (no valid equations). The bot should fall back to `drawCard` on every turn and the game should make forward progress. (Regresses the `botTickSeq` no-op path and the `drawCard` fallback.)
7. **Transition test:** start an offline vs-bot game, play 2 turns, then navigate to the online lobby, then back out. Confirm the bot clock does not fire while online (check console for unexpected `BOT_STEP` logs) and resumes cleanly when returning offline.
8. **Unrelated-re-render test:** during a bot think-time, trigger a notification or sound toggle that causes `GameProvider` to re-render. The bot should still fire its move at the original scheduled deadline, not reset its timer. (Regresses §0.5.2 `useRef` deadline stability.)
9. Online-vs-bot game on Render: completes end-to-end. (Regression check — we didn't touch the server, but verify nothing downstream broke. Ritualistic — this milestone shouldn't break this, but confirming it's cheap.)
10. Online multi-human (no bot): completes end-to-end.
11. Advanced settings panel: changing `enabledOperators`, `mathRangeMax`, and `timerSetting` each produces the expected in-game effect in single-player vs bot.
12. RTL check: set locale to Hebrew; verify mode toggle, bot difficulty toggle, and advanced disclosure all render correctly; verify the "Bot is thinking…" overlay text is right-aligned.

### 0.10a Known user-visible trade-off: local vs online bot behavior diverges

Because this feature uses `index.tsx`'s local reducer and does NOT unify it with `server/src/gameEngine.ts`, the offline vs-bot experience will differ from the online vs-bot experience in observable ways. The most visible difference is `PLAY_FRACTION` attack math:

- **Online vs bot** (server reducer): playing a 1/2 fraction card on a discard pile with top value 12 sets the defender's target to `12 / 2 = 6`.
- **Offline vs bot** (local reducer): playing the same card sets the defender's target to `2` (denominator only, not pile-top divided).

This is the same pre-existing divergence that affects pass-and-play locally vs online multiplayer today — it is NOT introduced by this feature. But once offline vs bot ships, a user who plays both modes will notice the bot seems to "play by different rules" depending on whether they're connected.

**Accepted trade-off.** Unifying the two reducers is a separate, much larger project (see §0.1 for the full divergence list — it's not just fraction math). Deferring that project is the central R1 decision.

**Do not attempt to patch around this** in the bot brain (e.g., by having the bot avoid fraction attacks to paper over the difference). The bot should play the local rules as they exist; if the local fraction rules are wrong, fixing them is the engine-unification project's job.

### 0.10 Decisions carried forward from the original spec

The following decisions from §4 remain valid and apply unchanged to the revised design:

- **Decision 4 (Easy + Hard):** Two bot difficulty levels.
- **Decision 5 (Profile 3):** Easy = minimizer comparator in `buildBotStagedPlan`. One-line difference from Hard.
- **Decision 6 (Option C — advanced disclosure):** StartScreen has defaults for casual players plus an "Advanced" disclosure for power users.
- **Decision 7 (useEffect bot clock):** Bot scheduling lives in `GameProvider` via a `useEffect` with a narrow dependency array.

The following decisions from §4 are **superseded by §0**:

- ~~**Decision 1 (Option B — offline bot in `GameContext`):**~~ The target is now `index.tsx`'s inline reducer, not `src/context/GameContext.tsx`.
- ~~**Decision 2 (Option A — move to `shared/`):**~~ No engine move. Bot lives in `src/bot/` and targets the local reducer directly.
- ~~**Decision 3 (A-full — delete old reducer):**~~ No reducer deletion. `index.tsx`'s reducer is the live reducer and stays intact.
- ~~**Decision 4a (rebuild GameScreen in place):**~~ No GameScreen rebuild. `index.tsx`'s inline `GameScreen` already speaks the new-engine vocabulary.
- ~~**Decision 4b (pass-and-play stays prominent):**~~ Still true, but for a simpler reason: we're not removing anything.

---

## 1. Problem

The single-player start screen (`src/components/screens/StartScreen.tsx`) offers pass-and-play only. The existing "vs Bot" functionality lives exclusively in the online multiplayer lobby (`src/screens/LobbyScreens.tsx`) and runs server-side; it requires an internet connection, a Render deploy, and a round-trip through the socket server. There is no offline / single-player way to play against a bot even though the bot logic already exists on the server.

Additionally, the local game in `src/context/GameContext.tsx` (517 lines) and the server game in `server/src/gameEngine.ts` (747 lines) are **different games** — different phases, different card types, different fraction-attack system, different equation flow, different settings model. This divergence is a pre-existing bug factory and is the real reason adding "vs bot" to single-player is non-trivial.

## 2. Goal

Single-player mode supports a "Play vs Bot" entry point on `StartScreen`, with an Easy/Hard bot difficulty selector and an advanced game-settings disclosure. The feature runs entirely offline in the client, with no socket server involved. The local game engine is unified with the server engine so there is a single source of truth for rules, and the existing server bot brain is reused without duplication.

## 3. Non-Goals

The following are intentionally deferred. Any of them becoming requirements changes the scope of this spec:

- Seedable RNG for deterministic bot testing.
- Bot hint / suggestion feature for human turns.
- Persisting the last-used bot difficulty between sessions.
- Multiple bots in one single-player game.
- Bot chat, personality, or taunts.
- Pause-on-background (React Native `AppState` integration).
- A-B-C game variant selection on `StartScreen`.
- Any new gameplay rules. This is a migration plus an entry point, not a rules change.

## 4. Decisions Log

Decisions made during the brainstorming session, in order, with the rejected alternatives:

| # | Question | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Offline bot vs online-reuse vs duplicate engine | **Option B — true offline bot in `GameContext`** | Works offline, no server dependency |
| 2 | Where does the shared engine live? | **A — move to `shared/`** | Pure TypeScript, runs identically in browser/RN and Node; two Node-only imports trivially replaceable |
| 3 | What happens to the old `GameContext` reducer? | **A-full — delete old reducer, rewire every screen** | One engine, one UI, long-term clean; rejected A-scoped because it perpetuates the duplication |
| 4 | How many bot difficulty levels? | **B — Easy + Hard** | Matches user expectation; rejected one-bot as too coarse and three-bot as diminishing returns |
| 5 | How does Easy play worse? | **Profile 3 — minimizer planner** | One-line change in `buildBotStagedPlan`; measurable; never produces "broken" behavior |
| 6 | Game settings exposure on `StartScreen` | **C — defaults + Advanced disclosure** | Casual users unaffected; power users have full control |
| 7 | Bot scheduling inside React | **A — `useEffect` clock in `GameContext`** | Matches server pattern exactly; bot brain stays pure |
| 4a | Delete local `GameScreen` or rebuild in place? | **Rebuild in place (P1)** | Preserves visual style; required by A-full |
| 4b | Pass-and-play status | **i — keep, prominent alongside vs-bot** | Both modes equal on `StartScreen` |

### 5.2 Shared RNG (`shared/rng.ts`)

Replaces the two `node:crypto` imports in the engine. Uses `Math.random` and a simple UUID v4 generator. Not cryptographically secure — this is a card game, not a casino.

```typescript
export function randomInt(lo: number, hi: number): number {
  return lo + Math.floor(Math.random() * (hi - lo));
}

export function randomUUID(): string {
  // RFC4122 v4 using Math.random
  const hex = [...Array(36)].map((_, i) => {
    if (i === 8 || i === 13 || i === 18 || i === 23) return '-';
    if (i === 14) return '4';
    if (i === 19) return ((Math.random() * 4) | 8).toString(16);
    return ((Math.random() * 16) | 0).toString(16);
  });
  return hex.join('');
}
```

Both the server and the client import from this file. The server no longer uses `node:crypto` for game randomness — if deterministic testing is ever required, we swap this file for a seedable PRNG in one place.

### 5.3 Client game state and action vocabulary

`GameContext` owns `ClientGameState`:

```typescript
import type { ServerGameState } from '../../shared/types';
import type { BotDifficulty } from '../../shared/bot/types';

export interface ClientGameState extends ServerGameState {
  botDifficulty: BotDifficulty | null;   // null = pass-and-play, no bots
  botPlayerIds: readonly string[];       // computed at START_GAME from players[].isBot
}
```

Actions:

```typescript
type GameAction =
  | { type: 'START_GAME';
      mode: 'pass-and-play' | 'vs-bot';
      players: Array<{ name: string; isBot: boolean }>;
      difficulty: 'easy' | 'full';
      botDifficulty?: BotDifficulty;
      hostGameSettings: HostGameSettings;
    }
  | { type: 'PLAYER_ACTION'; action: EngineAction }   // all human moves
  | { type: 'BOT_STEP' }                              // fired by the clock
  | { type: 'RESET_GAME' };
```

`EngineAction` is a tagged union mirroring the `shared/gameEngine.ts` function signatures:

```typescript
type EngineAction =
  | { kind: 'beginTurn' }
  | { kind: 'rollDice' }
  | { kind: 'playIdentical'; cardId: string }
  | { kind: 'playFraction'; cardId: string }
  | { kind: 'confirmEquation'; result: number; equationDisplay: string;
      equationCommits: EquationCommitPayload[] }
  | { kind: 'stageCard'; cardId: string }
  | { kind: 'unstageCard'; cardId: string }
  | { kind: 'confirmStaged' }
  | { kind: 'drawCard' }
  | { kind: 'endTurn' }
  | { kind: 'defendFractionSolve'; cardId: string; wildResolve?: number }
  | { kind: 'defendFractionPenalty' };
```

The reducer is a thin dispatcher: `PLAYER_ACTION` and `BOT_STEP` both funnel into `executeBotAction`-style calls against the shared engine. Old action names (`PLAY_CARDS`, `CONFIRM_EQUATION { equationResult }`, `SELECT_CARD`, `PLAY_IDENTICAL`, `PLAY_OPERATION`, `PLAY_FRACTION`, `PLAY_JOKER`, `DRAW_CARD`, `END_TURN`, `NEXT_TURN`, `BEGIN_TURN`, `ROLL_DICE`, `OPEN_JOKER_MODAL`, `CLOSE_JOKER_MODAL`) are **deleted**.

**Note on `playFraction` vs. the bot's split `playFractionAttack` / `playFractionBlock`:** `EngineAction` has a single `playFraction` because the engine function `playFraction(state, cardId)` internally detects attack vs. block from `state.pendingFractionTarget`. The bot's `BotAction` union (§5.5) splits them for strategic clarity inside the brain, but the executor collapses both back into the same engine call. This split exists only to make bot decision logs readable; it has no gameplay effect.

### 5.4 Bot clock (`useEffect` in `GameProvider`)

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (state.phase === 'game-over') return;
  const current = state.players[state.currentPlayerIndex];
  if (!current || !state.botPlayerIds.includes(current.id)) return;

  if (state.phase !== 'turn-transition'
      && state.phase !== 'pre-roll'
      && state.phase !== 'building'
      && state.phase !== 'solved') return;

  const delay = 900 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 700);
  const timer = setTimeout(() => dispatch({ type: 'BOT_STEP' }), delay);
  return () => clearTimeout(timer);
}, [
  state.phase,
  state.currentPlayerIndex,
  state.hasPlayedCards,
  state.stagedCards.length,
  state.equationResult,
  state.pendingFractionTarget,
  state.botPlayerIds,
  state.botDifficulty,
]);
```

**`BOT_STEP` reducer behavior:**

1. If `state.phase === 'game-over'`, return unchanged.
2. If current player is not a bot, return unchanged. (Defensive — stale dispatch after turn flip.)
3. Call `decideBotAction(state, state.botDifficulty ?? 'hard')`. If it returns `null`, return unchanged.
4. Call `executeBotAction(state, action)`. On success, return the new state.
5. On `{ error }`, fall back to `drawCard(state)`. If that also errors, return unchanged (truly stuck; clock will stop because next render sees same state).

The clock cleanup function guarantees no timer leaks. The narrow dependency array ensures re-schedules only happen when something the bot cares about has changed — not on every dispatch.

### 5.5 Bot brain interface

`shared/bot/types.ts`:

```typescript
export type BotDifficulty = 'easy' | 'hard';

export type BotAction =
  | { kind: 'beginTurn' }
  | { kind: 'playIdentical'; cardId: string }
  | { kind: 'playFractionAttack'; cardId: string }
  | { kind: 'rollDice' }
  | { kind: 'confirmEquation'; target: number; equationDisplay: string;
      equationCommits: EquationCommitPayload[] }
  | { kind: 'stageCard'; cardId: string }
  | { kind: 'unstageCard'; cardId: string }
  | { kind: 'confirmStaged' }
  | { kind: 'drawCard' }
  | { kind: 'endTurn' }
  | { kind: 'defendFractionSolve'; cardId: string; wildResolve?: number }
  | { kind: 'defendFractionPenalty' }
  | { kind: 'playFractionBlock'; cardId: string };
```

`shared/bot/botBrain.ts` — `decideBotAction(state, difficulty): BotAction | null`:

| Phase | Condition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `turn-transition` | — | `beginTurn` |
| `pre-roll` | `pendingFractionTarget !== null`, divisible number in hand | `defendFractionSolve` |
| `pre-roll` | `pendingFractionTarget !== null`, wild in hand | `defendFractionSolve` (wildResolve = `fractionPenalty`) |
| `pre-roll` | `pendingFractionTarget !== null`, counter-fraction in hand | `playFractionBlock` |
| `pre-roll` | `pendingFractionTarget !== null`, none of the above | `defendFractionPenalty` |
| `pre-roll` | identical-playable card in hand | `playIdentical` |
| `pre-roll` | attack-fraction playable on top of discard | `playFractionAttack` |
| `pre-roll` | — | `rollDice` |
| `building` | `buildBotStagedPlan(state, difficulty)` returns a plan | `confirmEquation` |
| `building` | no plan | `drawCard` |
| `solved` | planned cards remain in hand (not yet staged) | next `stageCard` |
| `solved` | all planned cards staged | `confirmStaged` |
| `solved` | staged state is no longer valid | `unstageCard` (rollback) |
| `game-over` | — | `null` |

The plan is **never stored**. `buildBotStagedPlan` is called every tick and must converge — i.e., given the same state, it returns the same plan, so the bot can incrementally execute it across ticks by re-computing.

`buildBotStagedPlan(state, difficulty)` is the only place Profile 3 matters:

```typescript
// Hard: maximize cards discarded per equation
// Easy: minimize cards discarded per equation
const better = difficulty === 'easy'
  ? (candidate: number, best: number) => candidate < best
  : (candidate: number, best: number) => candidate > best;

if (!bestPlan || better(score, bestPlan.score)) {
  bestPlan = { ...candidatePlan, score };
}
```

That is the entire "Easy" implementation. The Profile 3 decision made during brainstorming is deliberate: `handleBotDefense` (divisible → wild → counter → penalty) and `handleBotPreRoll` (identical → attack-fraction → roll) are **untouched** by `difficulty`. Only `buildBotStagedPlan`'s scoring comparator flips. Every identical play, every defense choice, every draw decision is identical between Easy and Hard. The only observable difference is that Easy's equations discard fewer cards per turn, which directly slows the bot's card count reduction. This is what makes Profile 3 measurable: a single counter (average cards discarded per equation) distinguishes the two difficulties.

`shared/bot/executor.ts` — `executeBotAction(state, action)`:

```typescript
export function executeBotAction(
  state: ServerGameState,
  action: BotAction,
): ServerGameState | { error: LocalizedMessage } {
  switch (action.kind) {
    case 'beginTurn': return beginTurn(state);
    case 'rollDice': return doRollDice(state);
    case 'playIdentical': return playIdentical(state, action.cardId);
    case 'playFractionAttack':
    case 'playFractionBlock': return playFraction(state, action.cardId);
    case 'confirmEquation': return confirmEquation(
      state, action.target, action.equationDisplay, action.equationCommits
    );
    case 'stageCard': return stageCard(state, action.cardId);
    case 'unstageCard': return unstageCard(state, action.cardId);
    case 'confirmStaged': return confirmStaged(state);
    case 'drawCard': return drawCard(state);
    case 'endTurn': return doEndTurn(state);
    case 'defendFractionSolve':
      return defendFractionSolve(state, action.cardId, action.wildResolve);
    case 'defendFractionPenalty': return defendFractionPenalty(state);
  }
}
```

### 5.6 Server rewire

`server/src/socketHandlers.ts` loses roughly 140 lines. The bot logic in `runBotStep` becomes:

```typescript
function runBotStep(io: IOServer, room: Room): void {
  clearBotActionTimer(room);
  if (!room.state || room.state.phase === 'game-over') return;
  const player = currentPlayer(room);
  if (!player?.isBot || player.isEliminated || player.isSpectator) return;

  const action = decideBotAction(room.state, 'hard');
  if (!action) return;
  applyBotState(io, room, (s) => executeBotAction(s, action));
  scheduleBotAction(io, room);
}
```

Online multiplayer bot difficulty is hardcoded to `'hard'`. If online bot difficulty selection is ever wanted, it becomes a `HostGameSettings` field — out of scope for this spec.

## 6. UI Changes

### 6.1 `StartScreen.tsx` — new layout

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│         [Salinda logo]           │
│      (subtitle)                  │
│                                  │
│  Mode:                           │
│    [ Pass and play ] [ Vs Bot ]  │   ← segmented control, two equal options
│                                  │
│  [if Vs Bot:]                    │
│    Bot difficulty:               │
│      [ Easy ] [ Hard ]           │   ← default Easy
│    Your name: [_________]        │
│                                  │
│  [if Pass and play:]             │
│    (existing player count +      │
│     player names UI, unchanged)  │
│                                  │
│  Game rule set:                  │
│    [ Easy ] [ Full ]             │   ← existing easy/full toggle
│                                  │
│  ▸ Advanced game settings        │   ← collapsed disclosure
│                                  │
│  [ Start game ]                  │
│  [ Show rules ]                  │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

Mode defaults to **Pass and play** so existing users are not disrupted. Bot difficulty defaults to **Easy**.

### 6.2 Advanced settings disclosure

When expanded, exposes:

| Setting | Control | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `enabledOperators` | Checkbox list `+ − × ÷` | `['+']` |
| `mathRangeMax` | Number input | `25` |
| `allowNegativeTargets` | Switch | `false` |
| `showFractions` | Switch | `true` |
| `showPossibleResults` | Switch | `true` |
| `showSolveExercise` | Switch | `true` |
| `timerSetting` | Radio `off / 30 / 60 / custom` | `off` |
| `timerCustomSeconds` | Number input (only when custom) | `60` |

Hidden from the panel (hardcoded to engine defaults): `diceMode` (`'3'`), `difficultyStage` (derived from easy/full toggle), `abVariant` (default).

### 6.3 Start dispatch

- **Pass-and-play:** `dispatch({ type: 'START_GAME', mode: 'pass-and-play', players: humanPlayers, difficulty, hostGameSettings })` — `botDifficulty` omitted; `botPlayerIds` becomes empty.
- **Vs-bot:** `dispatch({ type: 'START_GAME', mode: 'vs-bot', players: [{ name: humanName, isBot: false }, { name: botName, isBot: true }], difficulty, botDifficulty, hostGameSettings })`.

The reducer synthesizes a local-only `Room` shape `{ code: 'LOCAL', players }` to call `shared/gameEngine.ts`'s `startGame(room, difficulty, hostGameSettings)`. The resulting state is augmented with `botDifficulty` and `botPlayerIds` before being stored.

### 6.4 `GameScreen.tsx` — rebuild per P1

"Rebuild in place" means the file keeps its name and general layout, but its guts are rewritten to drive the new engine. The old `GameContext` reducer is **deleted** (§5.1, §5.3); this section is about the *screen file*, not the reducer. The local card-play interaction is rebuilt on top of the new engine's `building` → `solved` flow. Visual style (layout, colors, fonts, card renderings) is preserved; the interaction model changes:

- **Old:** select N cards, sum, press "Play."
- **New:** pick a result from `validTargets` in the `building` phase; the game transitions to `solved`; stage number/wild cards that satisfy the result; press "Confirm."

The interaction pattern mirrors the online-vs-bot UI as closely as possible. If `GameScreen.tsx` currently branches on local vs. online, those branches collapse — the local path is rewritten to drive the new engine, not the online path deleted. Screens that dispatch to a bot's turn disable all human input when `botPlayerIds.has(currentPlayer.id)`.

### 6.5 i18n keys (add to both `en.ts` and `he.ts`)

| Key | English | Hebrew |
|---|---|---|
| `start.mode` | Mode | מצב |
| `start.modePassAndPlay` | Pass and play | משחק מקומי |
| `start.modeVsBot` | Play vs Bot | שחק מול בוט |
| `start.botDifficulty` | Bot difficulty | רמת בוט |
| `start.botEasy` | Easy | קל |
| `start.botHard` | Hard | קשה |
| `start.advancedSettings` | Advanced game settings | הגדרות מתקדמות |
| `start.botName` | Bot | בוט |

Operator names, timer options, and other settings labels **reuse existing lobby translation keys**; no new keys for those.

## 7. Testing

### 7.1 Engine unit tests (`shared/gameEngine.ts`)

Pure-function tests driven by Vitest/Jest. Must cover:

- `startGame` produces a legal initial state (correct hand size, discard pile seeded, currentPlayerIndex within bounds).
- `doRollDice` generates valid targets matching `hostGameSettings.enabledOperators` and `mathRangeMax`.
- Full equation round: `beginTurn` → `doRollDice` → `confirmEquation` → `stageCard*` → `confirmStaged` completes a turn and advances `currentPlayerIndex`.
- Fraction attack chain: attacker plays `playFraction`; next player has `pendingFractionTarget !== null`; defender's `defendFractionSolve` with valid card advances; `defendFractionPenalty` draws correct count.
- Triple-dice penalty: every non-current player draws `die1` cards.
- Win condition: player with hand length ≤2 triggers `game-over`.

If server-side engine tests already exist, they are ported to `shared/` as part of milestone M1. If none exist, the suite above is written fresh in M1. **M1 cannot be merged without these tests green.**

### 7.2 Bot brain unit tests (`shared/bot/botBrain.ts`)

Pure-function tests driven by fixture states. Must cover:

- `turn-transition` → `{ kind: 'beginTurn' }`.
- `pre-roll` with identical-playable → `playIdentical`.
- `pre-roll` with attack-fraction playable → `playFractionAttack`.
- `pre-roll` with neither → `rollDice`.
- `pre-roll` under fraction defense, divisible number in hand → `defendFractionSolve`.
- `pre-roll` under fraction defense, only wild in hand → `defendFractionSolve` with `wildResolve: fractionPenalty`.
- `pre-roll` under fraction defense, only counter-fraction → `playFractionBlock`.
- `pre-roll` under fraction defense, nothing → `defendFractionPenalty`.
- `building` with winnable plan → `confirmEquation`.
- `building` with no plan → `drawCard`.
- `solved` with unstaged planned cards → `stageCard`.
- `solved` with all planned cards staged → `confirmStaged`.
- `solved` with invalid staged state → `unstageCard`.
- **Profile 3 test:** given an identical state, `decideBotAction(state, 'easy')` returns a `confirmEquation` with fewer staged cards than `decideBotAction(state, 'hard')`. This single test is the contract that Easy is measurably easier than Hard.

### 7.3 Manual playthrough checklist (before merging to main)

1. Online-vs-bot game on Render: completes end-to-end, bot plays normally. (Regresses `socketHandlers.ts` refactor.)
2. Offline single-player-vs-bot, Easy: completes; bot visibly plays timidly; human wins most games.
3. Offline single-player-vs-bot, Hard: completes; bot plays aggressively; human loses some games.
4. Offline pass-and-play, 2 players: completes. (Regresses `GameContext` rewire.)
5. Offline pass-and-play, 4 players: completes. (Regresses multi-player state handling.)
6. Online multi-human (no bot): completes. (Regresses engine-move.)
7. Advanced settings panel: changing `enabledOperators`, `mathRangeMax`, and `timerSetting` each produces the expected in-game effect.

## 8. Risks

Ranked by likelihood × blast radius:

| # | Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Engine move breaks production server | M1 lands as its own commit; server tests (or manual smoke of online mode) run green before proceeding to M2. Rollback is `git revert` of the single commit. |
| 2 | Rebuilding `GameScreen` card-play flow changes UX visibly | Mirror the online UI's interaction pattern; do not invent new UX; keep visual style constant. User (tom) accepts this as inherent to A-full. |
| 3 | Bot clock has subtle edge cases (stale dispatches, rapid re-schedules) | Narrow `useEffect` dependency array; defensive guard in the `BOT_STEP` reducer; fallback to `drawCard` on any bot-action error. |
| 4 | i18n drift between `en.ts` and `he.ts` | Every new key added to both files in the same commit. Existing i18n infrastructure falls back to English on missing keys at runtime. |
| 5 | React Native / Metro bundler rejects `node:crypto` imports from shared code | Already designed around — `shared/rng.ts` is pure JS. Server imports from `shared/rng.ts` too; no dual implementations. |

## 9. Rollout

Each milestone is a mergeable commit. Milestones 1–3 are server-side only. Milestones 4–7 are client-side only. If any milestone fails its gate, stop and reassess — do not bundle the next milestone's changes into a rescue commit.

| # | Milestone | Touches | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | Engine move to `shared/` | `server/src/gameEngine.ts` `deck.ts` `equations.ts` → `shared/`; add `shared/rng.ts`; update server imports | Engine unit tests pass; online multiplayer still works (manual smoke) |
| M2 | Shared bot brain + executor | Extract from `socketHandlers.ts` to `shared/bot/`; rewire `runBotStep` | Online-vs-bot still works (manual smoke) |
| M3 | Bot brain unit tests | `shared/bot/__tests__/botBrain.test.ts` | All tests pass including Profile 3 assertion |
| M4 | Client state layer rewire | Delete `src/types/game.ts`; rewrite `GameContext.tsx`; add bot clock | `GameContext` compiles. App is **intentionally broken** at this checkpoint — no screens touched. |
| M5 | Screen rewire | Every file that imported old action vocabulary; rebuild `GameScreen` card-play flow per P1 | Pass-and-play game playable end-to-end |
| M6 | `StartScreen` vs-bot entry point | Mode toggle, bot difficulty toggle, advanced disclosure, wire new `START_GAME` | Full manual playthrough checklist passes |
| M7 | Cleanup | Remove dead imports; verify no `src/types/game` references remain; re-run full manual checklist | No warnings; manual checklist clean |

## 10. Open Questions

None. All design questions were resolved during the brainstorming session. Any new question that arises during implementation returns to this spec for an amendment before code lands.
